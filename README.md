    A few notes:
    
    - To create an instance of XboxAdapter, right now you need to hard-code an absolute path for xboxcontroller64.dll 
    or xboxcontroller.dll. This is problematic for running on different machines. It would be good to get this to work 
    by looking for the DLL in the PATH.
    
    - Whatever OpenGL library the View ends up using (e.g. JOGL) will probably need to be added to the repository
